Welcome to **Open Source** world! Google Summer of Code(GSoC) is a program which provides university students with great opportunities to contribute to open source projects during summer break. See more details at [Official Website](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).

欢迎来到开源世界！Google Summer of Code (简称 GSoC，中文翻译作 **Google 编程之夏**) 是大学生在暑假期间参加开源项目的一个非常好的机会。[官网](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)

You can participate in this activity as long as you are college students over 18(include) years of age. You can treat GSoC as summer internship. The cost performance ratio and value of GSoC is higher than general interships in companies.

只要是你 18 周岁以上的大学生，就可以参加这个活动，你完全可以把它当作你的暑期实习，并且性价比和含金量都比一般实习还高。

## What kind of work you will be doing?

Briefly, you will have a unique opportunity to directly interact with awesome open source developers during the Summer! All that while being given a generous remuneration by Google! Depending on the open source organisation you choose, you may develop an existing project or you can propose a new one. It all depends on you! :)

简而言之，你需要为一个开源社区工作，然后从 Google 手里得到奖金。你可以开发一个现存的项目，或自己新建一个，这取决于你。

## How to apply GSoC?

Every **February**, the accepted organizations will be published on the [Official Website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/). The application starts from **March**, and all that required from you is a **proposal**(about what you plan to do and what you can contribute) to the organization. Once your proposal is accepted by the organization you applied for, you are enrolled in GSoC! To increase the chance you get accepted, we suggest you start early and get familiar with the organizations you are interested in. This is not as hard as you may imagine. [Full timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

每年**二月**，需要你参与的组织会公布在官网上，你可以在**三月**份正式开始申请，你需要做的只是发一份**提议**（关于你想做什么和对组织能做的贡献）。一旦你的提议被组织接受，你就可以参与 GSoC 了！我们建议你提早准备，申请比你想象的简单。
