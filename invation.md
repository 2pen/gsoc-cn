# How could I get invitation?

## if you are GSoC student from China already

- Please just create a pr to this file which contain a link to your GSoC project page [e.g mine is https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6008675886956544]

- If you don't want other people know which project you are working on, that's fine. Please ask someone you already know in GSoC-CN vote (create a pr) for you to prove you are GSoC student. And then you can get the invitation.

- You can send an email to our mail list(still working on it), irc channel(still working on it), telegram group(still workin on it) and say hello to us :) And we can of course invite you.

## if you haven't been selected as GSoC student but want to

- You could check our GSoC-Resources repo(still working on it) and ask help in mail list, irc, or telgram.

After all, enjoy it! :)
